 <li><span>1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>

 <li> <span>1944</span>Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 5.000 different strains of disease resistent wheat including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>

Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
